This repo is a fork of https://github.com/codeguy/php-the-right-way.
On March 27th I started to translate into german and contacted the author of the original version to let him know about it.
So noone has to do double work.
Because of few time and a vacation I made slow process. And when I wanted to continue I realized someone else did the job in my time of absence.

You can find the finished german translation [here](https://github.com/rwetzlmayr/php-the-right-way).

That's a common case of double work if original repo owner's don't intend to get their translations merged upstream. Or if there is no way of letting everyone know what is currently worked on. No offense to anybody :-)
